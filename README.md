# My Personal Website
This is the repository for my personal website at [bickers.dev](https://bickers.dev). The site has a few types of pages:
1. Home page has information about me. The content on this page can be reformatted to become my print resume: running `printResume("Phone Number")` changes the styling and brings up a print dialog to print/save PDF.
2. Book reviews: my thoughts on books I've read recently. There is also a listings page `reviews.html`.

## Todo
- Implement static site generator to compile book reviews and add to the site
- Write more book reviews!
