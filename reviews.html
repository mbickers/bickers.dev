                <h1>Book Reviews</h1>
                <p>
                    I don't feel like I've gotten the most out of a book until I take the time to reflect on it.
                    For me, that reflection often naturally evolves into a review, as I think about what I enjoyed and what I didn't.
                    I decided to start organizing and publishing these reviews because I want to help others figure out what to read, and because my own appreciation of texts has always been enhanced by understanding what other people have to say.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many nonfiction books are available for free (legally) to university students.
                    Through the University of Michigan I get access to many great ebook databases; I particularly like O'Reilly for Computer Science and SpringerLink for Math books.
                    I've had a great experience with those sites, and I'd highly recommend looking through what you have access to before buying or otherwise obtaining books.
                </p>

                    Quick shout-out to <a href="http://dannyreviews.com">Danny Yee's Book Reviews</a>.
                    Danny's reviews have helped me discover new books to read, offered valuable insight while reading, and guided me about how to collect and organize my own thoughts about books I've read.
                    I'm publishing my reviews with the hope that they could help someone else the way Danny's have helped me.
