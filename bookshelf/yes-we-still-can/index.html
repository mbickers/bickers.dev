<h1>Yes We (Still) Can by Dan Pfeiffer</h1>

<p>Review by Max Bickers, published 26 October 2020.</p>

<p>Pfeiffer is one of the hosts of Pod Save America, a political podcast hosted by several Obama administration officials.
As a Pod Save America listener whose favorite parts of the Pod are anecdotes from the Obama White House, there wasn&rsquo;t really any chance that I would dislike reading <em>Yes We (Still) Can</em>.</p>
<p>Beyond readers who already know him from his podcast, the book may still be a good read because of his humorous retelling of his personal journey, insight into what the White House is actually like, or as a reminder of what the world was like when there was a more decent and comptetent president in command.</p>
<p>Pfeiffer&rsquo;s own journey to the White House was unique and inspirational, and the president he served under had a campaign and presidency defined by hope.
In a message perfectly captured by the title, <em>Yes We (Still) Can</em> shows that there might be a way out of the current political mess, but only if everyone believes they can gets involved and make a difference.</p>
<p>This book was a little dated when I read it, as it was published in 2018.
I&rsquo;m looking forwards to reading his most recent book &ldquo;Un-Trumping America,&rdquo; although it may take on a different meaning depending on what happens a week from now, after the 2020 election.</p>
