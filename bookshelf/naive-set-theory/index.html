<h1>Naive Set Theory by Paul R. Halmos</h1>

<p>Review by Max Bickers, published 25 October 2020.</p>

<p><em>Naive Set Theory</em> is a short introduction to set theory, starting with the basic definition of a set and building up to the set theoretic foundation of arithmetic, important theories and cardinal numbers.
The content of the book was almost all new for me, so I can&rsquo;t compare it to other sources or say if it misses anything important.
But I can say it is well written&mdash;I came away from each chapter feeling like I understood what was going on.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/na-ve-set-theory">different review</a>, presumably from someone who actually knows what he is talking about, explains that the <em>Naive</em> in the title means the book is meant to build intuition rather than strictly develop theory.
That was my experience with the book, which aligned with my purpose for reading it.
In line with the lighter overall treatment of set theory, the book is occasionally funny&mdash;Halmos often makes fun of notation and vocabulary he doesn&rsquo;t like.
He also frequently summarizes new material with more intuitive language, which I found super helpful.
The humor, summaries and pacing make the book readable and memorable; for me, it was a fantastic first look at set theory.</p>
