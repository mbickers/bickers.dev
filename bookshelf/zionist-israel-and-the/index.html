<h1>Zionist Israel and the Question of Palestine by Tamar Amar-Dahl</h1>

<p>Review by Max Bickers, published 26 October 2020.</p>

<p>This book explores the history of Israel and Zionism through primary sources, focusing on ideological contradictions.
Unlike some books on Israel and Palestine, the text is not built around historical &lsquo;gotchas&rsquo; trying to demonize the other side&mdash;nor is there is an overarching &lsquo;pro-&rsquo; or &lsquo;anti-&rsquo; argument.
Amar-Dahl takes an academic approach with frequent footnotes, numbers and quotes from Israeli leaders, to discuss the contradictions that arise under critical inspection.</p>
<p>Although information-dense, the book wasn&rsquo;t a difficult read.
I came in with no knowledge beyond the basic history of modern Israel, and I learned a lot from reading it.
A lot of the text is pure quote contextualization and first-level analysis, which helped fill in the gaps of my history knowledge.</p>
<p>There were a few places where the wording felt biased.
For example, the book refered to some conflicts in Israel&rsquo;s history as &ldquo;wars of conquest,&rdquo; when a quick Google search showed that there wasn&rsquo;t a consensus that &ldquo;wars of conquest&rdquo; would be a justified term.
Even the title, &ldquo;Zionist Israel&hellip;,&rdquo; feels reactionary for an academic work, although that could be an artifact of translation from German.
These wording choices were never central to the arguments Amar-Dahl was making, so they are more distracting than anything else.
Nevertheless, they seem like odd choices in a work where that sort of historical controversy is otherwise avoided because evidence comes directly from primary sources.</p>
<p>The most memorable part of the book was the chapter analyzing Israel&rsquo;s dual identity as a Jewish state and a democracy, which usually implies a secular government.
Amar-Dahl explored both philosophical implications discussed in primary sources by Zionist thought leaders, and the practical consequences from throughout Israel&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>That chapter summed up why I liked reading this book.
It does a good job providing background and introducing meaningful questions, but leaves readers enough space to ponder the bigger implications and come to their own conclusions.</p>
