<h1>The C&#43;&#43; Programming Language by Bjarne Stroustrup</h1>

<p>Review by Max Bickers, published 25 October 2020.</p>

<p>Written by the creator of C++, this book was widely recommended online as a must-read for people who want to move beyond the basics of C++.
Before reading, I fell squarely into that category.
I had taken courses that covered iterators and standard library containers, but not much more than that.
This book helped me build a deeper understanding of C++ and the many language features that are available to programmers.</p>
<p>Bjarne&rsquo;s subtle sense of humor helps keep the text from becoming monotonous.
The examples are often chosen to elicit a laugh, and there are quotes at the beginning of each chapter that relate to content in a humorous way.
I won&rsquo;t lie&mdash;in some chapters, I started skimming, just reading the examples and particularly interesting bits.
With a book like this one, I think that&rsquo;s ok.
I came away with a better understanding of what features are available in C++, enough to know what might be applicable in a given problem.</p>
<p>In the introduction, Stroustrup emphasizes that the book isn&rsquo;t a reference book.
It systematically goes over different aspects of C++, but the chapters are more like tutorials than technical specifications.
The book can be read cover to cover, like I read it, or in a more random access sort of way, flipping to a chapter to quickly build an understanding of one specific part of the language.</p>
<p>One thing I didn&rsquo;t like was the online typesetting.
I read the book through O&rsquo;Reilly Safari Books Online, which was nice because it was free through school, but not nice because there were frequent typos and distracting formatting issues in the code.</p>
