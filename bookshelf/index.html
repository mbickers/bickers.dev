        <h1>Bookshelf</h1>

        <p>I don&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;ve gotten the most out of a book until I take the time to reflect on it.
For me, that reflection often naturally evolves into a review, as I think about what I enjoyed and what I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I decided to start organizing and publishing these reviews because I want to help others figure out what to read, and because my own appreciation of texts has always been enhanced by understanding what other people have to say.</p>
<p>Many nonfiction books are available for free (legally) to university students.
Through the University of Michigan I get access to many great ebook databases; I particularly like O&rsquo;Reilly for Computer Science and SpringerLink for Math books.
I&rsquo;ve had a great experience with those sites, and I&rsquo;d highly recommend looking through what you have access to before buying or otherwise obtaining books.</p>
<p>Quick shout-out to <a href="http://dannyreviews.com">Danny Yee&rsquo;s Book Reviews</a>.
Danny&rsquo;s reviews have helped me discover new books to read, offered valuable insight while reading, and guided me about how to collect and organize my own thoughts about books I&rsquo;ve read.
I&rsquo;m publishing my reviews with the hope that they could help someone else the way Danny&rsquo;s have helped me.</p>
