<h1>Seven Programming Languages by Bruce Tate</h1>

<p>Review by Max Bickers, published 26 September 2020.</p>

<p><em>Seven Programming Languages in Seven Weeks</em> is a really cool book.
The purpose of the book isn&rsquo;t just to expand the reader&rsquo;s toolbox of languages; instead, it&rsquo;s that the ideas and techniques in a language expand one&rsquo;s mind and are often applicable beyond the scope of that particular language.</p>
<p>As such, the book isn&rsquo;t a practical guide to programming in a given language.
Tate might show a &ldquo;Hello, World&rdquo; program, but then talk about the history and influences of a language and then give a longer code sample that shows off the language&rsquo;s strengths.
The examples are often short, seemingly simple programs in the given language that demonstrate an approach that might be painful or impossible in many other languages.</p>
<p>The languages explored in the book are Ruby, Io, Prolog, Scala, Erlang, Clojure and Haskell.
I particularly liked learning about Io.
Io was inspired by Smalltalk, and reading about it helped me recognize inherited Smalltalk elements that Io shared with Objective-C, a language I was already familiar with.
For example, it helped me understand that square bracket syntax for invoking methods in Objective-C isn&rsquo;t just a wacky syntactic choice&mdash;it reflects the idea of sending a message to an object as one can do in Smalltalk or Io.</p>
<p>While a feature or premise in one language may not have an analogue in another, I&rsquo;ve already applied many of the concepts covered in the book.
This book is definitely worth a read if you don&rsquo;t have experience with a diverse set of programming paradigms and languages and want to expand your horizons.</p>
